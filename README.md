# Calculate the median of the last 1000 tweets using REST API on serverless

This project implements a lambda AWS function using serverless, which exposes a REST API to compute the median length of the last 1000 tweets.

# Setup

1) Create an AWS account: 
  1.1) In order to connect to the serverless framework you need an AWS account. You can create one here https://aws.amazon.com/
  1.2) Go to the AWS Management console and then to the IAM service. Create a new group with the following policies:
      - AWSLambdaFullAccess: This policy is needed to implement 1 function in the serverless framework, which is our median function.
      - AmazonAPIGatewayAdministrator: This policy is needed in order to implement our function as a REST API.
      - AdministratorAccess: This policy is needed in order to grant serverless access to your AWS account. The access can be minimized by         configuring a cfnRole in the serverless framework. For simplicity, I'll leave it as it is.
      
2) Edit the config.js file to include your consumer and app keys from the Twitter developer portal.
3) Run 'npm install' to get the dependencies.
4) Run 'sls deploy' in your CLI to deploy the project in your AWS server.
5) Access your function by copying the endpoint URL in your browser. 
   Note that the function expects 1 query string parameter, called q, so add '?q=<term>' to your endpoint.
  
# How to use

Send a GET request to the endpoint with 1 query string parameter, q, and provide a <term>. The function will search the most recent 1000 tweets and return median length.

# Notes

1) I decided to use the Standard Search API for twitter for 2 reasons:
    - It's sufficient: the API search tweets within the last 7 days. Because Twitter is a very popular website, 1000 tweets are easy to get       for almost every term provided.
    - It's free.
